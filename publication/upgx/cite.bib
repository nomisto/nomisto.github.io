  abstract = "BACKGROUND: Reuse of EHR data for selecting patients who are
              eligible for clinical research can substantially improve the
              recruitment process. ART-DECOR is an open-source tool that is
              commonly used to design and publish HL7 V3 templates of national
              (e.g. ELGA) and international EHR initiatives. OBJECTIVES: Extend
              ART-DECOR to allow the definition of criteria that may be used
              for patient selection. METHODS: Using the native ART-DECOR
              development framework we extended existing ART-DECOR template
              associations by allowing conditions to be formulated. RESULTS: An
              editor for the specification of conditions was implemented. The
              resulting criteria are internally translated to XPath expressions
              and can be immediately applied to CDA documents. As a
              prototypical application of our approach we implemented a ``Trial
              Criteria Evaluator'' tool that allows trial eligibility criteria
              to be composed of our ART-DECOR criteria and have them checked
              against a patient's CDA documents. CONCLUSION: Referring to HL7
              templates, our criteria can be applied to documents of national
              EHR systems such as ELGA and hereby reach a broad patient cohort.
              Implementing our approach within ART-DECOR alleviates its reuse
              and enhancement by other researchers.",
