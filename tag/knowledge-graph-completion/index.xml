It uses rules learned by AnyBURL (Anytime Bottom Up Rule Learning), a highly-efficient approach for learning logical rules from knowledge graphs. AnyBURL [Meilicke et al., 2019, 2020] is currently one of the best performing symbolic rule learners and demonstrated results competitive with embedding methods on link prediction benchmarks such as FB15k-237. However, the application of rules generated by Any-BURL is currently limited by functional redundancies, making it difficult to meaningfully aggregate predictions made by different rules and thereby limiting predictive performance.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>We introduce the high-performance rule application framework SAFRAN (’Scalable And fast non-redundant rule application’) that employs a novel aggregation approach. We propose an algorithm called Non-redundant Noisy-OR that detects redundant rules prior to aggregation, mitigating their negative effects and improving predictive performance. This algorithm for aggregating predictions is not necessarily restricted to rules learned by AnyBURL and could also be applied to other rule-based system&lt;/p></description></item></channel></rss>
