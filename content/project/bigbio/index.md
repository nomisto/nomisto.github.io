BigBIO (BigScience Biomedical) is an open library of biomedical dataloaders built using Huggingface's (ðŸ¤—) datasets library for data-centric machine learning. Our goals include

- Lightweight, programmatic access to biomedical datasets at scale
- Promote reproducibility in data processing
- Better documentation for dataset provenance, licensing, and other key attributes
- Easier generation of meta-datasets (e.g., prompting, masssive MTL)

Currently BigBIO provides support for

- more than 120 biomedical datasets
- 10 languages
- Harmonized dataset schemas by task type
- Metadata on licensing, coarse/fine-grained task types, domain, and more!
