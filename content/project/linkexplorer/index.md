The LinkExplorer is a web-based tool for exploring nodes and relations of link prediction benchmark datasets and explanations of predictions done with the rule-based approach SAFRAN. A running instance of this tool can be found at:

http://explore.ai-strategies.org

Included are three biomedical knowledge bases:

- OpenBioLink
- Hetionet
- Pheknowlator

and two general-domain benchmarks:

- YAGO3-10
- WN18RR
