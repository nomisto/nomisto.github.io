abstract: Recently, novel machine-learning algorithms have shown potential for predicting undiscovered links in biomedical knowledge networks. However, dedicated benchmarks for measuring algorithmic progress have not yet emerged. With OpenBioLink, we introduce a large-scale, high-quality and highly challenging biomedical link prediction benchmark to transparently and reproducibly evaluate such algorithms. Furthermore, we present preliminary baseline evaluation results.

# Summary. An optional shortened abstract.
summary: In this paper, an novel biomedical knowledge graph is introduced, covering a broad spectrum of biomedical entities.
