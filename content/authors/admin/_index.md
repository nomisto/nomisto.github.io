I am a graduate research assistant at the Institute of Artificial Intelligence at the Medical University of Vienna, where I work on computational language, knowledge graphs and machine learning.

I have a formal background in Computer Science and gathered experience at a software company during studies. I am interested in solving real-world problems that involve using advanced machine learning techniques.
